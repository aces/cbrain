# CBRAIN Bourreau Puma Configuration
#
# This config file setup up puma, the web server
# used by the CBRAIN Bourreau application,
# to listen exclusively on a local unix-domain socket,
# located in Bourreau/tmp/sockets/bourreau.sock .
#
# The only client that will connect to it is the portal,
# which does it through a SSH tunnel that points to
# the unix-domain socket.

# This is used for setting up paths etc.
bourreau_install_location = Pathname.new(__FILE__).parent.parent.realpath

# Specifies the `environment` that Puma will run in.
environment ENV.fetch("RAILS_ENV") { "development" }

# Puma can serve each request in a thread from an internal thread pool.
# The `threads` method setting takes two numbers a minimum and maximum.
# Any libraries that use thread pools should be configured to match
# the maximum value specified for Puma. Default is set to 5 threads for minimum
# and maximum, this matches the default thread size of Active Record.

# Store the pid of the server in the file at "path".

# Redirect STDOUT and STDERR to files specified. The 3rd parameter
# ("append") specifies whether the output is appended, the default is
# "false".
