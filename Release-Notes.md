Several bug fixes, enhancements, and new features. The layouts of

As of now, new development will occur in a branch called "dev".
The branch named "master" will always point to the latest release
including special patches. When a new release is ready in "dev",
we will merg it to "master" and tag it there.

#### Version 4.0.1 Released 2015-05-19

This release contains several bug fixes and tidying of loose ends
from the 4.0.0 public release. Most of the fixes are descrived
under the milestone "Post Public Release" in the GitHub issue tracker.

#### Version 4.0.0 Released 2015-03-27

This is the first publicly released version of the CBRAIN platform.
There are still significant rough edges in the code and the
installation procedure, and the Wiki documentation is about 80%
complete.

In the near future, we plan to:

- Move our code issues from our internal Redmine server to GitHub's issue tracker.
- Implement significant performance improvements that have revealed themselves necessary in production.
- Finish the documentation.
