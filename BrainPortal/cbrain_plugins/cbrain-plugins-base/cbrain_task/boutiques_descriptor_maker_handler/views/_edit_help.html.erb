<h1>Boutiques Descriptor Maker</h1>

This form allows you to design and visualize a Boutiques descriptor
for a task.

<p>

The descriptor is in JSON format and the syntax is very strict.

<p>

You start with a sample descriptor with five example inputs (a file,
a string, a number, a flag and a selection box).

<p>

Add new inputs and meta data as needed, and click on the <strong>Check
Descriptor</strong> button to refresh this page and validate the
descriptor.

<p>

If the descriptor's syntax is valid, it will be re-validated by
<em>bosh</em> and messages will be shown below. If this validation
step works too, then an example of the generated command will be
shown, based on the content of the generated form shown underneath.

<p>

You can enter values in the generated form to see what effects they
have on both the validation and the command line. <strong>Note:</strong>
because the form shows the inputs from the previous round of
'checking the descriptor', you may have to click the <strong>Check
Descriptor</strong> button twice to get the form data posted and the
descriptor's input properly in sync.

<p>

At any time, you can return to the initial example descriptor by
wiping blank the entire JSON descriptor text area.

<h2>Recommendations</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure you enter a proper name for the tool, something with
    no spaces or special characters, e.g. "Brainmangler" or "SuperConfabulator"
  </li>
  <li>
    The 'tool-version' also needs a proper string value.
  </li>
  <li>
    The 'author' and 'descriptor-url' fields are for the author of
    the tool. Enter your own name in the "custom -&gt; 'cbrain:author'"
    section instead.
  </li>
</ul>
