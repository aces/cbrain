Description:
  Stubs out a model and a view for a new CbrainTask.
  Pass the plain task name as the first argument, in
  camel case format.

Usage:
  rails generate cbrain_task TaskName [--advanced] [--license license_file] [--plugin-name name]

Options:
  --advanced    : will include templates for the advanced
                  PortalTask API methods in the
                  Ruby code template for the task. Otherwise,
                  only the standard methods will be inserted
                  in the template.

  --license     : will add the text present in license_file
                  at the beginning of each template.

  --plugin-name : plugin name to generate the stubs under.
                  For example, specifying 'foo' would generate
                  the stubs under cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-foo/.
                  Defaults to 'local' if unspecified.

Example:

    rails generate cbrain_task UniversalTranslator

  will create these directories, Ruby code files and ERB and HTML view files:

  * Directories:
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/portal/
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/bourreau/
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/common/
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/views/
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/views/public/

  * Ruby code files:
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/portal/universal_translator.rb
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/bourreau/universal_translator.rb
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/common/universal_translator.rb

  * ERB partials:
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/views/_task_params.html.erb
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/views/_show_params.html.erb

  * HTML excepts for documentation
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/views/public/edit_params_help.html
    cbrain_plugins/cbrain-plugins-local/cbrain_task/universal_translator/views/public/tool_info.html

  Note that the path component 'cbrain-plugin-local' is a name given to a
  dummy CBRAIN plugins package; feel free to rename it as needed
  once you're ready to distribute your task.

  The created files, once modified to suit your needs, are fully
  ready to be deployed by running the standard rake task
  "cbrain:plugins:install:all".
