# Helpers to apply user-specified scopes on CBRAIN's models or collections for
# viewing purposes. Scopes are a flexible and safe way to define which filtering
# and sorting rules to apply on a given collection before display and keep
# track of custom view options and pagination information.
#
# Scopes currently in use are usually stored in Rails' session, and can easily
# be converted to and from hashes. For example, a scope to filter by an
# attribute named user_id and sort by name would look like:
#   scope = Scope.from_hash({
#     :filters => [
#       {
#         :attribute => :user_id,
#         :value     => 10,
#       },
#     ],
#     :order => [
#       {
#         :attribute => :name,
#         :direction => :asc,
#       },
#     ]
#   })
# To then apply this scope to a collection or model, use the scope's apply
# method:
#   scoped_tools = scope.apply(Tool)
#
# Currently active/known scopes are stored in Rails' session as a hash with
# scope names for keys and scope hash definitions/representations as values:
#   current_session['scopes'] == {
#     'userfiles' => { 'f' => [ ... ], 'o' => ... },
#     'tasks'     => { 'f' => [ ... ], 'o' => ... },
#     ...
#   }
# To directly add or replace one of the session scopes, convert the scope to a
# compact hash representation first before adding to
# +current_session['scopes']+:
#   current_session['scopes']['tasks'] = scope.to_hash(compact: true)
#
# Scopes created from hashes and session attributes are automatically sanitized
# and it is thus safe to pass user-supplied values to create them.
# Note that scopes stored in Rails' session are in compact hash representation,
# see +Scope+'s +compact_hash+ method for more information.
#
# NOTE: While similar to ActiveRecord's scoping mechanism, the scopes defined in
# this module mainly target views and are expected to be 'closer' to the user
# than ActiveRecord's scopes (which would pose a security risk if they could be
# directly accessed).

  # This method, called just before any action (as a before_filter), allows
  # updating the session's view scopes just before the control is handed to the
  # controller.
  #
  # The following query parameters are recognized by +update_session_scopes+:
  #
  # [_scopes]
  #  Expected to be a hash of changes to be merged in the session's scopes as
  #  specified by CbrainSession's +apply_changes+ method.
  #
  # [_default_scope]
  #  Expected to be a hash to be merged in the current route's default scope
  #  (current_session['scopes'][+default_scope_name+]). Behaves similarly to
  #  +_scopes+, as it too uses CbrainSession's +apply_changes+ method.
  #
  # [_scope_mode]
  #  Merging mode to employ when merging into session scopes using +_scopes+ or
  #  +_default_scope+. Corresponds to the mode parameter of CbrainSession's
  #  +apply_changes+ method. Defaults to 'replace'.
  #
  # [page, per-page/per_page]
  #  Common pagination parameters to update the scope named _pag_scope_name
  #  with. These parameters correspond to the *page* and *per_page* attributes
  #  of Scope::Pagination, and are handled purely for convenience and
  #  convention; the same functionality (and more) can be accessed by
  #  passing a hash to the +_scopes+ parameter instead.
  #
  # [_pag_scope_name]
  #  Name of the scope to update with the page and per-page/per_page parameters.
  #  Defaults to the current route's default scope name (+default_scope_name+).
  #
  # [_simple_filters]
  #  Special flag to indicate that the remaining query parameters are to be
  #  interpreted as simple attribute => value filters (each corresponding to a
  #  { :a => <attribute>, :v => <value>, :o => '==' } Scope::Filter).
  #  This simplified interface is meant to be used when manually composing URLs
  #  without aid from the Scope API (such as in applications outside CBRAIN
  #  or when composing by hand). For example, an URL to filter userfiles on a
  #  certain data provider could look like:
  #    http://portal.cbrain.ca/userfiles?_simple_filters=1&data_provider_id=4
  #  instead of the full version required by the +_scopes+ parameter.
  #
  #  To specify which scope to update, have +_simple_filters+'s value be the
  #  name of the target scope. If such a scope is not found,
  #  +update_session_scopes+ will then try the controller's name (common
  #  convention for index pages) and +default_scope_name+. If none of these are
  #  present (on a new CBRAIN session, for example), a new scope named after
  #  +_simple_filters+'s value will be created, unless +_simple_filters+'s value
  #  is empty or a true-like value (1, 't', 'true', 'TRUE', ...), in which
  #  case the new scope's name will fall back to +default_scope_name+. For
  #  example, doing (with an active session):
  #    http://portal.cbrain.ca/userfiles?_simple_filters=tasks&...
  #  would update the 'tasks' scope, if it exists, while:
  #    http://portal.cbrain.ca/userfiles?_simple_filters=1&...
  #  would try to update the 'userfiles' scope, falling back to
  #  +default_scope_name+ if there is no 'userfiles' scope. On a blank/new
  #  session, doing:
  #    http://portal.cbrain.ca/userfiles?_simple_filters=1&...
  #  would create a new scope named +default_scope_name+, while:
  #    http://portal.cbrain.ca/userfiles?_simple_filters=tasks&...
  #  would create a scope named 'tasks'.
  #
  #  Note that this option cannot be used in conjunction with +_scopes+ or
  #  +_default_scope+, and that every query parameter (other than
  #  +_simple_filters+, +_scope_mode+, and pagination parameters) is considered
  #  to be a filter.
