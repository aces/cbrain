# This module will attempt to force an output file
# created by the boutiques integrator to be stored
# with a "browse_path" under the target destination
# DataProvider, if possible. e.g.
#
#    "custom": {
#        "cbrain:integrator_modules": {
#            "BoutiquesForcedOutputBrowsePath" : {
#              "supertool_output_dir":  "derivatives/supertool",
#              "supertool_html_report": "reports/[VERSION]/supertool",
#            },
#        }
#    }
#
# The keys are IDs of the output-files section of the descriptor,
# and the values are relative paths on the target result DP.
# The relative paths can contain templated values that will be
# substituted when the results are saved.
#
# If the target DP doesn't have browse_path capabilities, the
# browse path will be set to nil and a warning will be added
# to the task's log.
