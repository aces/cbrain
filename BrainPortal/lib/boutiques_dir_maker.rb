require 'fileutils'

# Some tools expect that a directory e.g. results, etc exists in the working directory
#
# While traditionally we add to the boutiques command line prefix akin to 'mkdir -p [OUTPUT];'
# external collaborators might dislike polluting the command line with technical staff
# or need a clean boutiques descriptor which does not create any new folders
# The the `cbrain:integrator_modules` section look like:
#
#     "BoutiquesDirMaker":
#          [ "[OUTDIR]", "[OUTDIR]/[THRESHOLD]_res", "tmp" ]
#
# Please avoid special characters save underscore and hyphen, and
# use relative paths. Boutiques templates (hereafter called patterns) are supported

  # Note: to access the revision info of the module,
  # you need to access the constant directly, the
  # object method revision_info() won't work.
