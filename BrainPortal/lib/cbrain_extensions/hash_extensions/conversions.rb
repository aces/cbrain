      # This method allows you to perform a transformation
      # on all the keys of the hash; the keys are going to be passed
      # in turn to the block, and whatever the block returns
      # will be the new key. Example:
      #
      #   { "1" => "a", "2" => "b" }.convert_keys!(&:to_i)
      #
      #   returns
      #
      #   { 1 => "a", 2 => "b" }

      # as HTML element attributes.
      #
      #   { "colspan" => 3, :style => "color: #ffffff", :x => '<>' }.to_html_attributes
      #
      # will return the string

      #   'colspan="3" style="color: blue" x="&lt;&gt;"'

      # for the XML root tag.
