<h1>Managing Tasks</h1>
<br>
<br>

The various operations, allowing you to have a certain amount of control over the execution of tasks, are listed below.  Tasks are assigned different stages as they proceed through processing.  Those stages include "Setup", "Queued", "Cluster", "Post Processing" and "Completed" stages.  The <b>Setup</b> stage sets up the files to be processed. When a task is <b>Queued</b> it is waiting to be processed.  The <b>Cluster</b> (also referred to as the running stage) stage is the scientific processing stage. The <b>Post Processing</b> stage saves the results back to the CBRAIN data provider.  The <b>Completed</b> stage indicates that the processing has been completed.  Should a task fail, failure recovery code can be triggered.
