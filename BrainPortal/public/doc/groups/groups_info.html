<h1>Understanding Projects</h1>
By selecting the <b>Create Project</b> drop down menu under the <b>Projects</b> tab, you can create a new project.  The resulting project is a Work Project that only the creator of the project can access.  Additional users can be added to a project by the system administrator.
<br><br>
<b>Projects</b>
<br>
<br>
Projects facilitate the sharing of files and resources between users.  When an <b>Active Project</b> is selected, files and resources associated with that particular project become available under the various tabs.
<br>
<br>
There are four types of projects: system projects, site projects, user projects and work projects.
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>System Projects</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Every user on CBRAIN is automatically a member of the system project everyone.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Site Projects</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Each site has a site project automatically associated with it.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>User Projects</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Every user on CBRAIN is automatically assigned to a project, that only they are a member of, specified by that user's username.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Work Projects</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>A work project is a type of project that can be created by anyone.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
At the top of the page the <b>Active Project</b> can be selected.
