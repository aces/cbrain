<h3>Viewing Files</h3>
The <b>Files</b> tab, called the file manager, is a link to an interface that displays a list of files, file details and a file management menu bar at the top of the page.  The file management menu bar consists of seven tabs.  More details can be displayed for each file by selecting the <b>Toggle Details</b> button. Jiv Files are shown as links under files with Jiv files as children resulting from a minc2jiv operation.  Additionally Files highlighted in pink are unavailable.  Each individual file has a details page that can be accessed by clicking on that particular file.

<h3>Sidebar</h3>
<p>The sidebar provides the options to <b>Toggle Details</b>, <b>Show all files on the system</b> and <b>Tree View</b>.  The <b>Toggle Details</b> button allows the user to see more details of the files.  <b>Tree View</b> gives the user the ability view the parent and child files hierarchically.
<br>    
A user can search by filename. Additionally, <b>Active Filters</b> lists the filters currently applied to the files which can be removed by clicking on the 'x' beside the applied filter.
<br>
<br>
<b>Filter Files Drop Down</b>
<br>
<p>The filter files drop down allows a user to filter their files by type or by tag (shown below).  A tag is a marker that can be created and be used to mark or "tag" a file.  Files can be searched by filters and tags.  This drop down allows a user to filter files either by the preset filters or by custom filters.

<b>Upload File</b>
<br>
The <b>Upload File</b> drop down in the file management menu, which allows a user to upload individual files and compressed files with sizes up to 250MB.  The interface is shown below.  You can browse for these files on your local computer, assign tags to the uploaded file, groups and group file permissions, archive options (for zip and tar files) and CBRAIN will store the file.  Note that the compressed files cannot have folders within it.  Compressed files have the option to be saved as it is, extracted or a file collection of the compressed files can be generated.  The preferred method for uploading files to CBRAIN is through the data providers tab.<br>

Project permissions can also be updated by selecting the file along with selecting the desired project permission.</p>

<b>Groups</b>
<br>
Groups facilitate the sharing of files between users.  There are four types of groups which are all subsets of projects and include: system groups, site groups, user groups and work groups.
<br>
<ul>
<li><b>System Groups</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Every user on CBRAIN is automatically a member of the system group everyone.</li>
    </ul>

<li><b>Site Groups</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>Each site has a site group automatically associated with it.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>User Groups</b></li>    
    <ul>
        <li>Every user on CBRAIN is automatically assigned a group, that only they are a member of, specified by that user's username.</li>
    </ul>
<li><b>Work Groups</b></li>
    <ul>
        <li>A work group is a type of group and also a project that can be created by anyone.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

    File permissions are managed through projects.  Projects allow sharing of files between members of a project.  Users can be members of any project that either the site manager or the CBRAIN administrator assigned to them or that they created themselves. A file can only belong to one project but a user can belong to many projects.  Project permissions can be set by selecting the file, <b>Update Files Attributes</b>, the project and the permissions.<br><br>

<b>Creating a Collection</b><br>
   The <b>Create Collection</b> button on the files menu allows a user to select files and create a collection.<br>

<br><b>Moving and Copying Files</b><br>
    Files can be selected and moved or copied from one data provider to another using the <b>Move/Copy Files</b> button on the files menu.<br>

<br><b>Jiv Viewer</b><br>
    Jiv Viewer is another tool available in the file management menu under <b>Jiv Viewer</b>.  This drop down menu provides a list of the Jiv files in the files list, which can be selected and viewed using the <b>Jiv Viewer</b> in a Java Applet window.<br><br>

<b>Using Tools</b><br>
    
    The <b>Conversion Tool</b> and <b>Scientific Tool</b> drop downs on the file management menu provide a drop down selection of conversion and scientific operations that can be applied to files as tasks. When a tool is selected from the drop down menu, another select box appears to specify an execution server to complete the task.  Execution servers that have that particular tool available and that you have sufficient privileges to access, will be presented as possible selections along with an option to select a cluster to execute the task randomly.  For some tools, you must select files and the desired tool to be brought to an option selection page.  An example tool option page is shown below.<br><br>

    <p>Once a task has completed, the resulting files are placed in the files list on the <b>Files</b> tab page.  For example, once a Civet task has been run using the <b>Civet Tool</b> a <b>Civet Collection</b> is returned.  Clicking on that particular resulting Civet Collection from a Civet task brings you to the file details page (see below).  Through this page you can see the details of the civet collection, change the group, group permissions and update the tags associated with a file.  The <b>Contents</b> link displays the Civet output image file.  Also the link <b>Display full CIVET file list</b> displays all the files in the Civet Collection, which can be extracted individually.</p>
