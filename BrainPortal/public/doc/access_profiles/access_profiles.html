<h1>Introduction To Access Profiles</h1>

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

Access profiles are way to simplify how users are assigned to projects.

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

An access profile is basically a set of arbitrary projects. When a user is created
or modified, it can be assigned to one (or several) access profiles, and thus
it becomes a member of all the projects in these access profiles.

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

For the sake of clarity, let's use three terms to link the three concepts
of <em>users</em>, <em>projects</em> and <em>access profiles</em>.

<ul>
  <li><em>Users</em> are <strong>members</strong> of <em>projects</em></li>
  <li><em>Projects</em> are <strong>assigned</strong> to <em>access profiles</em></li>
  <li><em>Users</em> are <strong>linked</strong> to <em>access profiles</em></li>
</ul>

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

It is possible for a project to be assigned to several access profiles,
and for a user to be linked to these profiles with the redundant project.
In that case, the user stays a member of the project as long as that project
is assigned to at least one of these profiles. In other words, the set
of projects that the user is a member of is the <strong>union</strong>
of all the projects of all his linked access profiles.

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

Access profiles and all their properties are never visible to normal users.
As far as they are concerned, they are members of projects, and that is all.

<h4>Creating an Access Profile</h4>

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

When creating a new access profile, the admin can set a color to help
differentiate it from other access profiles. Projects can also immediately
be assigned to it.

<h4>Deleting an Access Profile</h4>

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

Removing an access profile will not delete the projects assigned to it.
However, all users who were linked to the profile will no longer
be members of the projects assigned to that profile
(except those projects that may be assigned to other access profiles).

<h4>Adjusting an Access Profile: adjusting the projects</h4>

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

Adjusting the set of project assigned to an access profile will (by default) immediately
affect all users linked to that access profile. If new projects are
assigned to the profiles, the users will become members of them. If projects
are de-assigned to the profile, the users MAY lose membership of them.

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

When using the form, the admin can select which users will be affected by
the changes using the checkboxes at the bottom of the project list. If
a checkbox is not checked for a user, that user's project memberships
will not be changed at all no matter what modifications are made
to the access profile.

<h4>Adjusting an Access Profile: adjusting the users</h4>

<p class="medium_paragraphs">

Adjusting the list of users linked to an access profile will affect
all those users: they will either become members of all the projects in
the profile (if the user is added) or might lose access to all these
projects.
