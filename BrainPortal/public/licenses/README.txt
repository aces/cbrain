This directory is where the CBRAIN administrator can install
HTML license and other important information files that will be presented to the user when
logging in. A description of what the HTML files should
contain and how to configure the licenses in CBRAIN can
be found in the documentation.

The information files which do not require signing should ends
with _info.html, for example maillist_form_info.html. Files relevant to
NeuroHub should start with nh- prefix, e.g. nh-Mailist_Subscription_info.html.
If CBRAIN and NeuroHub files are
named similiary (save for nh- prefix), they are considered equivalent and
shown just once. The semantic of double nh- prefix is undefined, avoid it.
