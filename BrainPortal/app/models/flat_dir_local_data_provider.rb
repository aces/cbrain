# The provider's files are stored in a flat directory, one
# level deep, directly specified by the object's +remote_dir+
# attribute. The file "hello" is thus stored in a path like this:
#
#     /remote_dir/hello
#
# There is no caching in this provider: all caching methods
# access the direct path to the local file.

# This provider is "browsable".
