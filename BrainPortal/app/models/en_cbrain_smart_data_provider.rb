# This class implements a 'wrapper' data provider that
# acts either as a EnCbrainLocalDataProvider or a EnCbrainSshDataProvider
# depending on whether or not the current hostname matches
# the value of the attribute remote_host.
#
# This means that in the case where the current Rails application
# runs on the same machine as the data provider, the faster
# and more efficient EnCbrainLocalDataProvider will be used.
