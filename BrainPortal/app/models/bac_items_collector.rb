# This class provides a utility 'aggregator' or 'collector' for the
# list of items of BackgroundActivity (aka 'BAC') objects.
#
# The collector object is created and configured with
# a max number of items, and then the +add_items+ method
# can be invoked repetitively to add one or many items to a
# list maintained internally by the collector. Whenever that list
# exceeds in length the max number of items, a BAC object is created
# and saved to the database with that number of items.
#
# The collector is created by providing an existing BAC object (which doesn't
# even need to be saved to the database) as the model of all the BAC
# objects the collector will create. The collector keeps its own copy
# internally, and all attributes will be preserved except for the items
# list and the counters.
#
#   # Build a collector that creates a MoveFile BAC
#   # for every 5 items we push to it.
#   col = BacItemsCollector.new(
#     BackgroundActivity::MoveFile.new(
#       :user_id => 1,
#       :remote_resource_id => 1,
#       :status => 'InProgress',
#       :options => { :dest_data_provider_id => 45 }
#     ), 5)
#
#   # Push one item; the item will just be stored
#   # internally because we haven't reached the limit.
#   col.add_items(4)
#
#   # Push six more items in one go; this will trigger
#   # the creation of a MoveFile BAC with items 4,5,6,7,8
#   # while items 9, 10 remain in the collector.
#   col.add_items([5,6,7,8,9,10])
#
#   # Create a MoveFile BAC for the remaining two items.
#   col.flush
#
#   # Get a list of the IDs of all the BACs the collector
#   # has created so far.

  # +bac_template+ is a BackgroundActivity object representing exactly
  # what kind of object we want the collector to create over time,
  # as items accumulate. It doesn't have to be an object that exists in
  # the database (a new() object works just as well). All its attributes
  # must be properly initialized such that it COULD be saved, except
  # for the items list and the counters. The collector keeps its own
  # copy of the object, and resets the items and counters internally.

  # (using +add_items+) for the collector to create a BAC object.
