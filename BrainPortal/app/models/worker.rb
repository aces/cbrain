# = Worker Class
# This class is responsible for managing a separate UNIX worker subprocess.
# When a worker is started a new process is spawned meaning there will be two 'copies'
# of each object. One copy is inside the main process and acts as a ':proxy' to control
# the other one, which is running in the subprocess as the ':worker'.
#
# Some methods apply only to the :proxy object, while other apply only to the :worker.
#
# A typical real world worker is created by defining a subclass of Worker and
# providing an implementation to these methods: do_regular_work(), setup() and
# finalize() (these last two are optional).
#
#   class MyWorker < Worker
#    def do_regular_work
#      puts "Doing work"
#    end
#   end
#
# Then a worker can be launched and monitored this way:
#
#   w = MyWorker.new( :check_interval => 4 ) # w is a :proxy
#   w.start
#   sleep 10
#   w.stop
#
# The code on the :worker side, in do_regular_work(), can inform or
# query the Worker superclass by calling these methods:
#
#   request_sleep_mode(interval = nil)
#   cancel_sleep_mode()
#   stop_signal_received?()
#   stop_me()
#   cancel_stop_me()
#   is_proxy_alive?()
#
# The :proxy side can interact with the :worker side with
# these methods:
#
#   self.find_existing_workers()
#   start()
#   stop()
#   wake_up()
#   is_alive?()
#
