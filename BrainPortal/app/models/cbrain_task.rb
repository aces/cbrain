# Model representing a job request made to an remote execution server (Bourreau) on a cluster.
# Typically this class is not used directly, instead intermediate subclasses are
# used on the BrainPortal side and on the Bourreau side:
#
#   PortalTask  < CbrainTask # on portal side
#   ClusterTask < CbrainTask # on bourreau side
#
# Most of the methods here are useful both on the BrainPortal side and on
# the Bourreau side; for methods that should only be used on a particular
# side, see the classes PortalTask and ClusterTask respectively.

  # The attribute 'prerequisites' is a serialized hash table
  # containing the information about whether the current
  # task depend on the states of other tasks. As an example,
  # if the hash is this:
  #
  #     {
  #        :for_setup           => { "T12" => "Queued", "T13" => "Completed" },
  #        :for_post_processing => { "T66" => "Failed" },
  #     }
  #
  # then the task will be setup by a Worker only when task #12 and #13 are
  # in the indicated states or further, and the task will enter post_process() only
  # when task #66 has failed. The only allowed keys right now are
  # :for_setup and :for_post_processing, as these are the only two
  # states triggered by Workers.
  #
  # The task's ID are serialized with strings with a prefix consisting
  # of the single character 'T'. This is needed so that the structure
  # is properly serialized in XML during ActiveResource transport.
  #
  # The only allowed state values for the conditions are:
  #
  #  - 'Queued' (which also covers ALL subsequent states up to 'Completed')
  #  - 'Data Ready' (which also covers 'Completed')
  #  - 'Completed'
  #  - 'Failed' (which covers all failures)
  #
  # As an aside, note that in a way, a task ID 'n' in the CbrainTask attribute
  # :share_wd_tid also implies this prerequisite:
  #
  #     :for_setup => { "T#{n}" => "Queued" }
  #
  # unless a more restrictive prerequisite is already supplied for task 'n'.

  # hash you can add any number of other keywords. See the full example

      "run_number" => self.run_number.to_s  || "UnknownRunID",
      "cluster"    => self.bourreau.name,
    }
  end

  # Utility method to help create new numbered keywords for
  # the pattern renaming helpers. See the helper method
  # output_renaming_fieldset() in TaskFormHelper to create the
  # frontend. This method is normally used in save_results()
  # (in ClusterTask) to build a new filename for an output.
  # Here's an example. Let's say we have an input filename
  # and a output pattern:
  #
  #   infile   = params[:infilename]              # "patient-00123_45.txt.gz"
  #   pattern  = params[:output_renaming_pattern] # "out-{in-2}.{in-3}.{date}.gz"
  #
  # The user would like the output to be "out-00123.45.2013-03-18.gz".
  # So in save_results, you build a set of keywords:
  #
  #   keywords = output_renaming_standard_keywords # std keywords, like '{time}' and '{date}'
  #   output_renaming_add_numbered_keywords(keywords, infile, "in-") # add '{in-1}', '{in-2}' etc
  #
  # At this point, the hash table 'keywords' contains:
  #
  #   {
  #     'date' => '2013-03-18', 'time' => '11:56:09', 'run_number' => '1', 'cluster' => 'execname', 'task_id' => '12343',
  #     'in-1' => 'patient', 'in-2' => '00123', 'in-3' => '45', 'in-4' => 'txt', 'in-5' => 'gz'
  #   }
  #
  # Then you call the string method pattern_substitute() to build the
  # output filename:
  #
  #   outname = pattern.pattern_substitute(keywords)  # returns "out-00123.45.2013-03-18.gz"
  #
