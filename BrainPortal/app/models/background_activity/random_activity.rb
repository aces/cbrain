# A set of fake, debug tests.
#
# The set can contain tests that will succeed, fail, or
# raise an exception, and the tests can take a certain
# mount of time too. The items array look like this:
#
#   [ "2-ok", "3-fail", "19-exc", "4-ok" ... ]
#
# where there number is how long to sleep at the beginning of
# each test, and the keyword is what gets reported to the
# framework.
