# Releases a CBRAIN task. This is the cluster operation of
# releasing a job currently On Hold
#
# This is part of a set of four cluster operations
# that, within CBRAIN, have no supporting interface elements
# or API calls:
#
#   suspend, resume, hold, release
#
# This is implemented for the sake of completing the official
# CBRAIN low-level job control features.
