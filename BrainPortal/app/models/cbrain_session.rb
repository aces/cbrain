# user's session object can be accessed using the current_session method of

# Meant as a wrapper around Rails session hash, this model is mostly used
# to add additional reporting/monitoring logic, to cleanly support partial
# updates and to validate certain session attributes.

  # Update sessions attributes from the contents of +changes+. +changes+ is
  # expected to be either a +hash+ of attributes to update, a +mode+ and a
  # +hash+ (pair) or a list of those to be applied in order:
  #   apply_changes({ ... }) # Single hash
  #   apply_changes([:delete, { ... }]) # Pair
  #   apply_changes([{ ... }, { ... }]) # List of hashes
  #   apply_changes([[:append, { ... }], [:delete, { ... }]]) # List of pairs
  #
  # While similiar to Hash's merge method, this method has a few key
  # differences:
  #
  # - Hashes in +hash+ and session attributes are recursively merged:
  #     @session # { :a => { :b => 1 } }
  #     apply_changes({ :a => { :c => 1 } })
  #     @session # { :a => { :b => 1, :c => 1 } }
  #
  # - nil values are automatically removed from hashes to avoid clutter. This
  #   cleanly allows removing keys from hashes:
  #     @session # { :a => { :b => 1 } }
  #     apply_changes({ :a => { :b => nil } })
  #     @session # { :a => {} }
  #
  # - apply_changes does not accept a block; session attributes are always
  #   overwritten by their new value in +hash+, if present.
  #
  # +mode+ determines what kind of update should be performed. The possible
  # +mode+s are:
  #
  # [:replace]
  #  Replace colliding values in session attributes from the ones in +hash+,
  #  regardless of their type (default mode).
  #
  # [:append]
  #  Replace colliding values, as in +:replace+, except when at least one of
  #  them is a collection (Array or Set), in which case the resulting value
  #  is the union of both collections (or the collection and the element).
  #
  # [:delete]
  #  Remove any non-colliding value present in +hash+ from session
  #  attributes, except for collections (Array or Set), from which the elements
  #  in +changes+ are substracted.
  #
  # While oddly specified, this method is hopefully intuitive to use and allow
  # a wide range of operations from just an input hash and a mode switch.
  # For example:
  #   # Adding a key to the session
  #   @session # { :a => 1 }
  #   apply_changes({ :b => 2 })
  #   @session # { :a => 1, :b => 2 }
  #
  #   # Adding an element to an array in the session
  #   @session # { :a => { :c => [1] } }
  #   apply_changes([:append, { :a => { :c => [2] } }])
  #   @session # { :a => { :c => [1, 2] } }
  #
  #   # Removing keys from the session
  #   @session # { :a => { :c => 1, :d => 2 } }
  #   apply_changes([:delete, { :a => { :c => nil, :d => 2 } }])
