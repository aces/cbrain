# Model representing access profiles, a sort of
# record where pre-defined profiles for users are created
# by the admin.
#
# For the moment the model only contains:
#
# A list of group_ids (a profile can have many of these)
# A list of user_ids  (a profile is 'applied' to these users)
#
# Later on, access restrictions will be
# recorded here too. For instance, restrictions and
# limits of launching tasks, number of files, etc etc.
