    This document describes the different types of Data Providers
    implemented in CBRAIN. Not all of them are useful. In production
    environments, the recommended type is the <strong>EnCbrainSmartDataProvider</strong>
    for official data storage and <strong>SshDataProvider</strong> for user-specific
    personal storage.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <strong>SshDataProvider:</strong> This class provides an implementation for a data provider
    where the remote files are accessed through ssh and rsync.
    The provider's files are stored in a flat directory, one
    level deep, directly specified by the object's remote_dir
    attribute. The file "hello" is this stored in a path like this:
    <pre>    /remote_dir/hello</pre>

    <p>

    <strong>CbrainSshDataProvider:</strong> This class provides an implementation for a data provider
    where the remote files are accessed through ssh and rsync.
    The provider's files are stored in the 'CBRAIN enhanced
    directory tree'; such a tree stores the file "hello"
    of user "myuser" into a relative path like this:
    <pre>    /remote_dir/myuser/01/23/hello</pre>
    where the components "01" and "23" are computed based on the "hello" string.
    <p>

    <strong>CbrainLocalDataProvider:</strong> This class provides an implementation for a data provider
    where the remote files are not even remote, they are local
    to the currently running rails application. The provider's
    files are stored in the 'cbrain enhanced
    directory tree'; such a tree stores the file "hello"
    of user "myuser" into a relative path like this:
    <pre>    /root_dir/myuser/01/23/hello</pre>
    where root_dir is the data provider's remote_dir (a local
    directory) and the components "01" and "23" are computed based
    on the hello string.
    <p>
    This data provider does not cache anything! The 'remote' files
    are in fact all local, and accesing the 'cached' files mean
    accessing the real provider's files. All methods are adjusted
    so that their behavior is sensible.
    <p>

    <strong>CbrainSmartDataProvider:</strong> This class implements a 'wrapper' data provider that
    acts either as a CbrainLocalDataProvider or a CbrainSshDataProvider
    depending on whether or not the current hostname matches
    the value of the attribute remote_host.
    This means that in the case where the current Rails application
    runs on the same machine as the data provider, the faster
    and more efficient CbrainLocalDataProvider will be used.
    <p>

    <strong>EnCbrain*DataProvider:</strong> These three providers are <strong>en</strong>hanced variations
    on the other three Cbrain*DataProviders described above. They differ
    in how the store their files. The path to file is no longer based
    on its owner or the filename, but instead uniquely determined by
    the file's ID. A file named "hello" with ID 41233 will be stored
    like this:
    <pre>    /root_dir/04/12/33/hello</pre>
    Such data providers have the advantage that files can be renamed and
    reassigned to new owners with minimal modifications on the filesystem's
    structure. The EnCbrain*DataProviders are the officially recommended
    data providers for production deployment.
    <p>

    <strong>VaultSshDataProvider:</strong> This class provides an implementation for a data provider
    where the remote files are accessed through ssh and rsync.
    The provider's files are stored in a flat directory, two levels
    deep, directly specified by the object's remote_dir
    attribute and the user's login name. The file "hello"
    of user "myuser" is thus stored into a path like this:
    <pre>    /remote_dir/myuser/hello</pre>
    <p>

    <strong>VaultLocalDataProvider:</strong> This class provides an implementation for a data provider
    where the remote files are not even remote, they are local
    to the currently running rails application. The provider's
    files are stored in a flat directory, two levels
    deep, directly specified by the object's remote_dir
    attribute and the user's login name. The file "hello"
    of user "myuser" is thus stored into a path like this:
    <pre>    /root_dir/myuser/hello</pre>
    where root_dir is the data provider's remote_dir (a local
    directory).
    <p>
    This data provider does not cache anything! The 'remote' files
    are in fact all local, and accessing the 'cached' files mean
    accessing the real provider's files. All methods are adjusted
    so that their behavior is sensible.
    <p>

    <strong>VaultSmartDataProvider:</strong> This class implements a 'wrapper' data provider that
    acts either as a VaultLocalDataProvider or a VaultSshDataProvider
    depending on whether or not the current hostname matches
    the value of the attribute remote_host.
    This means that in the case where the current Rails application
    runs on the same machine as the data provider, the faster
    and more efficient VaultLocalDataProvider will be used.
    <p>

    <strong>IncomingVaultSshDataProvider:</strong> This class behaves like the
    VaultSshDataProvider, except that it is browsable. When browsing, only
    the subdirectory named like the login name of the current user will
    be visible. It is perfect for accessing
    a jailed remote_dir for incoming content, where users
    can upload files to these subdirectories on other channels.
