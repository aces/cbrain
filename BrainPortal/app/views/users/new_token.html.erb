<% title 'New API Token' %>

<h2>New API Token</h2>

We have just generated a new API token for you.
<p>
  <code class="copy-text"><%= @new_token %>
    <%= copy_to_clipboard_button(@new_token) %>
  </code>
<p>

If you are a developer and want to automate working
with CBRAIN or NeuroHub, this token will be needed
to access the APIs.
<p>
Refer to the CBRAIN API documentation
for more information.
<p>
<strong>A note about this token</strong>:

<% pretty_how_long = SessionHelpers::SESSION_API_TOKEN_VALIDITY.inspect %>
<ul>
  <li>
    This token will only be valid for <%= pretty_how_long %>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every time a request is made with it, it becomes valid for another <%= pretty_how_long %>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The first time it is used, the IP address of the connecting client will be
    recorded and only connections from that IP address will be valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a subsequent connection comes from any other IP address at any time,
    the token will immediately be invalidated.
  </li>
</ul>
