<h2>New API Token</h2>

We have just generated a new API token for you.
<p>
<div>
  <code id="api_token" ><%= @new_token %></code>
  <button class="button" title="Click this button to copy the API token to the clipboard" onclick="copy_text_to_clipboard()">
  <!-- SVG copy icon (akin to unicode's copy symbol but clean) -->
    <svg width="12" height="12" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" >
      <rect x="4" y="4" width="14" height="14" rx="2" ry="2" fill="#d1d5da" stroke="#6a737d" stroke-width="1.25" />
      <rect x="7" y="7" width="14" height="14" rx="2" ry="2" fill="#d1d5da" stroke="#6a737d" stroke-width="1.25" />
    </svg> copy to clipboard
  </button>
</div>
<p>

If you are a developer and want to automate working
with CBRAIN or NeuroHub, this token will be needed
to access the APIs.
<p>
Refer to the CBRAIN API documentation
for more information.
<p>
<strong>A note about this token</strong>:

<% pretty_how_long = SessionHelpers::SESSION_API_TOKEN_VALIDITY.inspect %>
<ul>
  <li>
    This token will only be valid for <%= pretty_how_long %>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every time a request is made with it, it becomes valid for another <%= pretty_how_long %>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The first time it is used, the IP address of the connecting client will be
    recorded and only connections from that IP address will be valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a subsequent connection comes from any other IP address at any time,
    the token will immediately be invalidated.
  </li>
</ul>
