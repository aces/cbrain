  # Fetch the possible values (and their count) for +attribute+ within

  # As this method is intended as a view helper to create the list of values to
  # filter a collection/model with, the possible values are returned as a list
  # of hashes matching +DynamicTable+'s filter format (unless +format+ is
  # specified; see below), containing:
  # [:value]
  #  Possible value for +attribute+.
  # [:label]
  #  Label (string representation) for +:value+ (or just +:value+ if
  #  unavailable).
  # [:indicator]
  #  Count of how many times this specific +:value: was found for +attribute+ in
  #  +collection+.
  #
  # This method accepts following optional (named) arguments:
  # [label]
  #  Attribute name (as a string or symbol) representing which +collection+
  #  attribute to use as value labels. Defaults to the value of +attribute+ if
  #  left unspecified.
  #
  # [association]
  #  Association to join on +collection+. Expected to be in the same format as
  #  +Scope+::+Filter+'s *association* attribute, it roughly fulfills the same
  #  purpose; allow +attribute+ and +label+ to refer to attributes on the joined
  #  model (only applicable if +collection+ is an ActiveRecord model).
  #
  #  If :association is specified and is an AR model, +attribute+ is also
  #  allowed to be nil to indicate that it should automatically be selected as
  #  the foreign key of the first association on +collection+ matching the given
  #  +association+ model. The +label+ option will also default to the 'name'
  #  attribute on the given +association+ (and will refer to the association
  #  model unless qualified by a table name). This behavior allows generating
  #  association filters without explicitly specifying the association join
  #  attributes. For example,
  #    filter_values_for(@userfiles, nil, :association => DataProvider)
  #  is equivalent to the more verbose
  #    filter_values_for(@userfiles, 'data_provider_id',
  #      :label       => 'data_providers.name',
  #      :association => DataProvider
  #    )
  #
  # [format]
  #  Lambda (or proc) accepting three arguments; a possible value for
  #  +attribute+, a label for the value, and a count of how many times this
  #  value was present. This lambda will be used to format the list of filter
  #  values, overriding the default +DynamicTable+ format specified above.
  #  Specifying +format+ is roughly equivalent to using map on the generated
  #  filter values but without having to unpack the +DynamicTable+'s filter
  #  format hash.
  #
  #  NOTE: The filters generated by this method are commonly used with the Scope
  #  and DynamicTable APIs, which impose an hidden restriction on the values
  #  that can be taken for +attribute+'s values; they must be safely
  #  deserializable from YAML. This is the case for almost all common value
  #  types with the notable exception of Symbols. If +attribute+'s values are
  #  symbols, consider converting them the resulting filter values to strings
  #  before using them to construct filtering URLs.

  # Fetch the possible filtering values for +attribute+ (symbol or string)
  # within +base+, viewed through +view+. +base+ is expected to be either an
  # ActiveRecord model (or scope) or Ruby Enumerable, while +view+ is expected
  # to be either the same type as +base+ or one or more Scope objects. This
  # method generates filtering values (similarly to +filter_values_for+),
  # considering +view+ as a filtered version of +base+ and counting possible
  # values in both.
  #
  # For example, if +base+ is the Userfiles model containing TextFiles, CSVFiles
  # and MincFiles and +view+ is a scope of base with just a few CSVFiles and
  # MincFiles, +scoped_filters_for+ one could have:
  #   scoped_filters_for(base, view, :type) # =>
  #   [
  #     { :value => 'TextFile', :indicator => 0, :label => '... (of 30)', ... },
  #     { :value => 'CSVFile',  :indicator => 9, :label => '... (of 10)', ... },
  #     { :value => 'MincFile', :indicator => 3, :label => '... (of 53)', ... },
  #   ]
  #
  # This method accepts the following optional (named) arguments:
  # [scope]
  #  One or more Scope objects to add on top of +view+, when +view+ isn't a
  #  collection of Scopes already.
  #
  # [label]
  #  Handled the same way as +filter_values_for+'s own +label+ parameter. Note
  #  that this includes the 'name' default if +attribute+ is nil and
  #  +association+ is specified.
  #
  # [association]
  #  Handled the same way as +filter_values_for+'s own +association+ parameter.
  #
  # [format]
  #  Lambda (or proc) to format the filter list with. Similar in behavior and
  #  handled the same way as +filter_values_for+'s own +format+ argument. The
  #  only difference between this method's +format+ and +filter_values_for+'s
  #  is a fourth argument, the possible value count under +view+.
  #  The arguments given to +format+ are thus: value, label, base count and
  #  view count.
  #
  # [strip_filters]
  #  Remove any Filter filtering on +attribute+ in all given Scope instances
  #  before applying them to +view+ (and generating filter counts). This avoids
  #  generating almost-empty filters (only a single value would have a count
  #  higher than 0). Defaults to active (true).
  #
  # Note that if Scope objects are supplied, any of their Filters filtering on
  # +attribute+ will be removed to avoid generating empty filters values unless
  # the +strip_filters+ argument is specified as false.
  #
  # Also note that this method shares +filter_values_for+'s special
  # interaction between +association+ and +attribute+; if +association+ is
  # specified and +attribute+ is nil, +attribute+ is taken as +base+'s
  # foreign key on +association+ (see +filter_values_for+'s +association+

  # items (ordering or filtering rules). This method is the internal
  # implementation of +scope_filter_params+ (and +scope_order_params+).
  # - +operation+ corresponds exactly to +scope_filter_params+'s +operation+
  # parameter.
  # - +scope+ is a Scope object corresponding to +scope_filter_params+'s +scope+
  # parameter.
  # - +attr+ is expected to be either :filters, to update scope filtering rules,
  # or :order, for ordering rules. It corresponds to the Scope attribute name
  # to apply +changes+ on.
  # - +changes+ corresponds to +scope_filter_params+'s +changes+ parameter, and
  # is expected to be an array of filter objects (Scope::Filter) or ordering
  # rules (Scope::Order).
  #
  # Note that unlike most other utility methods, this method is exclusively
  # intended to be used only to implement +scope_filter_params+ and
  # +scope_order_params+ and is most likely unsuitable for anything else.
