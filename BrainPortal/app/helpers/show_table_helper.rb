# Helper for generating standard CBRAIN show tables. The developer
# describes the attributes and headers for cells in the table and
# the helper then produces the necessary HTML to arrange them on a
# page.
#
# The primary method used is +show_table+ which will be passed the
# object being described and a block. The block will be passed a
# TableBuilder object to be used to describe the table.
#   <%=
#     show_table(@messages, :id => "messages_table", :class => "resource_list") do |t|
#       ...
#     end
#   %>
#
# Here, @messages is the list of object defining rows in the table. The second argument
# is just a hash table defining HTML attributes on the table.
