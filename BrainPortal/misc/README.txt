     Misc Directory
=========================================================================

This directory contains miscelleneous tidbits and scripts and commands
that can be (or not) useful to CBRAIN developers or administrators.

Content:

1- tst_dp.rb

   Source this in your console if you're working on developing
   a new DataProvider class; it will test the capabilities of
   the DP (upload, download, sync etc).

   tst_dp(246)    # runs the tests of your DP ID 246

   We suggest disabling SQL logs with "no_log" first (see the
   console's "cbhelp" command for more information).

2- Nothing else for the moment.
