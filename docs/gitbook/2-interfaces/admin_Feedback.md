## Feedback

In CBRAIN a user can leave feedback messages to the developer team. The administrator can click on the feedback link at the bottom of each page to show an index table with feedback messsages from users.

The index table shows an entry for each feedback message with a short **"summary"**, the **"author"** and the **"posted at"** information. There is a "Delete" button to delete a specific feedback message, for example if the feedback is no longer useful.

To obtain more details about a specific feedback message, click on the summary of the feedback and a page with additional information will be shown.
