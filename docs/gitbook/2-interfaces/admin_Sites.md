A Site is an administrative sub-domain which can be run without the
need for intervention from a system administrator (`UserAdmin`). A
Site is generally associated with one or more Site Managers
(`SiteAdmin`) who can act as an administrator for resources within
the site. See the page about [Users](admin_users.html).

## How to create a Site

* Go to the "Sites" tab.
* Open the "Create new Site" panel.
* Fill in the form:
  * **Name**: Name of the site
  * **Description**: First line should be a short description, which
    will be used in the Site table. After that you can add any special
    note for the users.
  * **Active Users**: You can use this table in order to add users
    one by one, and you can decide if the user that you have selected
    will be a `SiteManager` or a `NormalUser`.
  * **Projects**: You can use this table in order to select the
    members that belong to a specific project, and you can select
    more than one project.
  * **Locked Users**: By default these users are hidden in order
    to reduce the size of the table containing the active users.
