an administrator of the installation. There is a short introduction describing

For each CBRAIN platform you can have one or several user with administrator
privilege.
An administrator have access to everything in CBRAIN, they can
add/modify/delete all resources present in CBRAIN. For example he can add
some users, execution servers, data providers etc...

In the original platform some of the administrators are also programmers of
the platform but it is not a pre-requisite to be an administrator.
